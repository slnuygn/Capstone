## ICA Rejection Logic Implementation Summary

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Modified `ft_databrowser_modified.m`:

- **Removed** the flawed auto-save array creation and file saving logic
- **Added** `cfg.rejected_ICs = opt.reject_ICs;` to return rejected components in the output configuration
- **Fixed** subject index determination to use `cfg.current_subject_index` when available

#### 2. Modified `browse_ICA.m`:

- **Added** simple array initialization: `rejected_ICs_array = cell(length(ICA_data), 1)`
- **Each element** corresponds to one subject's rejected components
- **Pass subject index** to ft_databrowser via `cfg.current_subject_index = i`
- **Collect rejected components** after each ft_databrowser call
- **Improved figure handling** to prevent issues with subsequent subjects
- **Added script file saving** with timestamp for persistent storage

### How the Logic Works:

1. **Initialization**: Create a cell array with one cell per subject, all initialized as empty `[]`

2. **Iteration**: For each subject (i = 1 to number of subjects):

   - Pass the current subject index to ft_databrowser
   - User interacts with the interface to reject components
   - When ft_databrowser closes, collect the rejected component numbers
   - Store them in `rejected_ICs_array{i}`

3. **Storage**:

   - Each rejection adds the component number to the array for that subject
   - Multiple rejections create arrays like `[3, 7, 12]`
   - No rejections leave the array empty `[]`

4. **Output**:
   - Results saved to MATLAB workspace as `rejected_ICs_array`
   - Results saved to timestamped script file (e.g., `rejected_ICs_2025-09-27_14-30-25.m`)

### Example Output:

```matlab
rejected_ICs_array = {
    [3, 7];    % Subject 1: Rejected components 3 and 7
    [];        % Subject 2: No rejected components
    [2];       % Subject 3: Rejected component 2
};
```

### Key Improvements:

- **Simple and reliable**: Basic array structure, no complex nested logic
- **Per-subject tracking**: Each subject's rejections stored separately
- **Persistent storage**: Results saved to script file for later use
- **Better figure handling**: Prevents issues with multiple subject windows
- **Clear feedback**: Console output shows what was rejected for each subject

This implementation follows the exact logic you requested: a simple zeros-initialized array where rejected component numbers are stored per subject index during iteration.
